# **3D models in STL format**

Models that I fully designed in solidworks:
 - [Case](/models/custom_pcb_case) for custom PCB.

Models found in Thingiverse:
- [Clamp](/models/clamp) with gopro mounting system found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4561329).
- [HC-SR04 case](/models/hcsr04_case) found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3738687) but I adapted it with a gopro mount so it works with the clamp.
- [Solar charger case](/models/solar_charger_case) found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4614783) with some changes to make it slightly larger to accomodate the battery.
- [LCD case](/models/lcd_case) found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3839594).
